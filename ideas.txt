Tasks:
- separate words from emails into a dictionary (or set?)
	-- by which separators? (space, -, ., ...)
- filter out common words (a, and, or ...)
- maybe ignore all html tags except of a few (links, images ...)
- if available, message subject should have higher impact
- is it worth it to look at sender information (name, ip adress)?
